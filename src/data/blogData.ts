    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>React has evolved significantly over the years, and so have the best practices for building scalable applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the latest patterns and techniques that will help you build React applications that can grow with your team and user base.</p>

    <h2>Component Architecture</h2>
    <p>One of the most critical aspects of building scalable React applications is establishing a solid component architecture. Here are the key principles:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Component Composition over Inheritance</h3>
    <p>React favors composition over inheritance, and this principle becomes even more important as your application grows. Instead of creating complex inheritance hierarchies, break down your UI into smaller, reusable components.</p>

    <pre><code>// Good: Composition
function UserCard({ user, actions }) {
  return (
    &lt;Card&gt;
      &lt;UserAvatar user={user} /&gt;
      &lt;UserInfo user={user} /&gt;
      {actions && &lt;CardActions&gt;{actions}&lt;/CardActions&gt;}
    &lt;/Card&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>

    <h3>2. Container and Presentational Components</h3>
    <p>Separate your components into containers (smart components) and presentational components (dumb components). This separation makes your code more maintainable and testable.</p>

    <h2>State Management Strategies</h2>
    <p>As your application grows, managing state becomes increasingly complex. Here are some strategies to keep your state manageable:</p>

    <h3>Local State First</h3>
    <p>Start with local component state using <code>useState</code> and <code>useReducer</code>. Only lift state up when multiple components need to share it.</p>

    <h3>Context for Theme and User Data</h3>
    <p>Use React Context for data that many components need, such as theme preferences or user authentication data.</p>

    <pre><code>const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
  
  return (
    &lt;ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}&gt;
      &lt;MainLayout /&gt;
    &lt;/ThemeContext.Provider&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
    <p>Performance is crucial for scalable applications. Here are key optimization techniques:</p>

    <h3>1. React.memo and useMemo</h3>
    <p>Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components, and useMemo for expensive calculations.</p>

    <h3>2. Code Splitting</h3>
    <p>Implement code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense to reduce initial bundle size:</p>

    <pre><code>const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;Loading /&gt;}&gt;
      &lt;LazyComponent /&gt;
    &lt;/Suspense&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Testing Strategy</h2>
    <p>A comprehensive testing strategy is essential for scalable applications:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unit Tests</strong>: Test individual components and functions</li>
      <li><strong>Integration Tests</strong>: Test component interactions</li>
      <li><strong>E2E Tests</strong>: Test complete user flows</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Building scalable React applications requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. By following the principles outlined in this guide, you'll be well-equipped to build applications that can grow and evolve with your needs.</p>

    <p>Remember, scalability isn't just about codeâ€”it's about creating systems that your team can understand, maintain, and extend over time.</p>
